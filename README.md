# Donation-Drawing-Code

Hey! This is how my donation drawing code works. Essentially, the more that someone tips relative
to the rest of the pool, the higher the chance of being selected for the private giveaway. Please
note that donating more doesn't guarantee you'll be picked; it's only fair that everyone who
contributes gets a chance in the draw! Every penny helps!

If this code is super bad, please let me know. I haven't worked with Python in a year and I put
this together in less than an hour on a whim. I'm always looking to learn better code practices!
